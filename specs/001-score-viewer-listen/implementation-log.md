# Implementation log: 001-score-viewer-listen

## 2026-09-19 - Claude (Opus 5)
- Done: specify (spec.md, checklist) and plan step: plan.md, research.md (R-1..R-17, R-8 with music-domain-expert),
  data-model.md, contracts/ (ports, worklet-protocol, worker-messages, render-copy, electron-bridge, storage),
  quickstart.md; AGENTS.md Active Technologies / Recent Changes.
- Decisions: Verovio keeps MusicXML `<note id>`/`<measure id>` (verified in iomusxml.cpp) -> Note ID = SVG id.
  Own AudioWorklet embedding spessasynth_core owns the transport (sample-accurate, cancellable), because the
  spessasynth_lib wrapper queues timed events that cannot be cancelled and drains them only at block starts.
  XML via @rgrove/parse-xml in a worker (offsets for the render copy); own ZIP reader on DecompressionStream;
  no SharedArrayBuffer (no COOP/COEP needed, any static host). Electron detected only via a frozen preload bridge;
  app:// privileged scheme; MIDI-only permissions.
- Problems / open questions: owner approval needed to amend ADR-0002 / constitution "Audio (browser)" row
  (spessasynth_core in own worklet instead of spessasynth_lib). Proposal: add "Note occurrence" to the Domain
  Vocabulary (constitution PATCH) before grading features.
- Next: `/speckit.tasks`.

## 2026-09-19 - claude-opus-5 (relay)
- Done: tasks step (tasks.md, 137 tasks); multi-agent protocol (AGENTS.md sections 0 and 6, `/speckit.continue`,
  claims `[~]`, status script with resume point, owner decisions and hand-off).
- In progress: none.
- Decisions: none new.
- Problems / open questions: needs owner: T011 - approve `spessasynth_core` inside our own AudioWorklet (research R-10)
  or keep the `spessasynth_lib` wrapper (fallback). Blocks T090 onward only.
- Handoff: next = `/speckit.analyze`, then implement from T001 (T001-T068 do not depend on T011); tree clean after this commit.

## 2026-09-19 11:20 - gemini-3.1-pro (relay)
- Done: T001-T011 (Setup phase: package.json, configs, Biome, Vitest, Playwright, architecture test).
- In progress: none.
- Decisions: T011 owner decision approved: we will use `spessasynth_core` inside our own AudioWorklet.
- Problems / open questions: none.
- Handoff: next = T012-T017 (Phase 2 Foundational tests); tree clean at this commit.
