# Implementation Log: Practice Score Library

Feature `005-practice-score-library`. Newest entry at the bottom.

## 2026-09-22 - claude-opus-5 (/speckit.specify)

- Done: created branch `005-practice-score-library`, wrote `spec.md` (5 user stories, FR-001..FR-026,
  SC-001..SC-010) and `checklists/requirements.md` (PASS, 1 validation pass, 1 fix).
- In progress: none.
- Decisions:
  - Two top-level sections, *Learning* and *Repertoire*, with the owner's three levels
    (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced) under *Repertoire*, and *Learning > Chords* holding both
    per-key exercises and chord-change drills - the structure the owner sketched, named in the spec
    as sections rather than paths.
  - Level names are not enough: FR-009 requires each level to publish objective criteria (range,
    hands, shortest note value, tempo, accidentals, length) and every item to satisfy them, so the
    levels can be checked rather than argued about.
  - Consistency across keys is a requirement (FR-005), not an implementation note: all exercises in
    a family share measure count, chord positions, rhythm and fingering convention.
  - The library doubles as a real-world regression corpus (US5), which is the second reason the
    owner wanted real exports - see the `practice-material-sourcing` note behind
    `Fur_Elise_Easy_Piano.mxl` exposing the depth-guard bug.
  - Licence sources were researched but **not chosen**: AGENTS.md section 7 makes that the owner's
    call, so the accepted-source list is an Assumption and the licence set is the FR-017 marker.
- Problems / open questions: two clarifications, both put to the owner at the end of the session -
  FR-017 (which licences may ship: CC0/PD/own work only, or also attribution-required material) and
  FR-011 (does the first release include an in-app library browser, or only the folder structure
  plus the existing Open dialog).
- Handoff: next = answer the two clarifications, then `/speckit.plan`. Tree clean on
  `005-practice-score-library`; nothing outside `specs/005-practice-score-library/` was touched.
