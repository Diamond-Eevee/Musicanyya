# Implementation Log: Score browser with progress

## 2026-09-27 - claude-opus-5-5 (plan)
- Done: `/speckit.plan`. `plan.md`, `research.md` (R-1 to R-21), `data-model.md`, `contracts/progress-store.md`
  1.0.0, `contracts/score-browser.md` 1.0.0, `contracts/contract-changes.md` and `quickstart.md`. The Active
  Technologies and Recent Changes sections of `docs/agents/reference.md` are updated. The Constitution Check passes
  before and after design.
- Decisions: progress is an event-reduced record per content hash behind a new `ProgressStore` port (IndexedDB v3 +
  memory adapter). The browser is a modal `<dialog>`, never open during Play/Practice sessions, and it pauses Listen.
  Score identity no longer depends on a stored copy. Old attempts migrate with completeness "not recorded" (they count
  for best, not *Mastered*). The `music-domain-expert` review is summarised in research R-6 to R-10: whole-Score,
  all-hands scope for best/*Mastered*, exact integer comparison, floor display, a completed loop counts as *Practised*,
  and the *Suggested next* rules.
- Problems / open questions: the music-domain expert found that 003 FR-008's wording differs from the code (a stopped
  run is graded over all expected notes; the unplayed ones are missed). This is information only; it does not block
  013.
- needs owner: OD-1 best and *Mastered* only from whole-Score, all-hands runs (recommended: yes)
- needs owner: OD-2 *Mastered* also needs extra notes <= 10 % of the notes total; spec FR-024 gains it (recommended: yes)
- needs owner: OD-3 reset progress / remove file and progress also delete that Score's stored attempts (recommended: yes)
- needs owner: OD-4 deleting one attempt removes it from progress too (recommended: yes)
- needs owner: OD-5 add dev dependency `@axe-core/playwright` 4.13.0 (MPL-2.0, test only) for SC-007 (recommended: yes)
- needs owner: OD-6 delete retired `mx-library`, `mx-recent-list`, `IndexedDbScoreStore`/`ScoreStore` and their tests (recommended: yes)
- Handoff: next = `/speckit.tasks` (the plan assumes the recommendations; OD-2 changes spec FR-024 once approved).
  Nothing is implemented yet.
