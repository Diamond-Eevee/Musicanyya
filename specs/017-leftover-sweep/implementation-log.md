# Implementation log: 017-leftover-sweep

## 2026-09-30 - claude-opus-5.5 (specify, plan, tasks)
- Owner request (2026-09-30): "wrap up everything, open new branch with anything that is left, so main has no
  leftovers", tasks rated by model. Model fit: specify/plan are deep, claude-opus-5.5 fits.
- Before branching, the merged `main` (ebd5e79, 016 merged by the owner after gemini-3.8-flash's T050/T055) was
  re-verified: `pnpm lint` 0 errors (317 warnings); `pnpm typecheck` exit 0; `pnpm test` Test Files 284 passed (284) |
  Tests 6137 passed (6137); `pnpm test:e2e` 1105 passed, 692 skipped, 3 failed - `lookahead.spec.ts:363` (chromium,
  glide timing; then passed alone once, failed alone 3/3 once), `score-browser.spec.ts:343` (firefox, 013 T112; 3/3
  alone), `chrome-look.spec.ts:159` firefox (a Firefox driver protocol error closing a *skipped* test's context; skips
  cleanly alone). Audio clock measured back at 1.0x (3.007 s audio per 3.012 s wall, still 88.2 kHz).
- Done: spec.md (5 stories, FR-001..FR-012, SC-001..SC-004), plan.md, tasks.md (30 tasks, phases by tier: light 3,
  standard 17, deep 4, owner 3, polish 3), checklist (all pass). T002: the 16 open tasks of 001, 003, 004, 005, 011
  and 013 are marked `[>]` "moved to 017 T0xx" in their own tasks.md; `status.ps1` now shows 001-016 all done.
  New task T017: the lookahead glide flake. Encoding fix while copying: 005's lines read "Burgm�ller"/"F�r Elise".
- Problems / open questions: needs owner: OD-1 (T018, title rule when both work-title and movement-title exist);
  needs owner: the checks of Phase 4 (T025 real MIDI keyboard, T026 learner test, T027 five-person SC-008).
- Handoff: next = analyze (implement step 1), then T001 -> T003 -> US1 (T004-T015); tree clean at the commit.
