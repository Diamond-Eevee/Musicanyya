# Implementation Log: 018 Collapsible Browser Folder Tree

## 2026-10-01 - claude-opus-5.5 (specify, clarify, plan)
- Done: spec.md (4 stories, FR-001..FR-017, SC-001..SC-006), 3 clarifications (name click chooses and expands; reveal
  only on open; ancestor expansion is saved), plan.md, research.md (R-1..R-11), data-model.md,
  contracts/browser-view.md (013 score-browser 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0), contracts/contract-changes.md, quickstart.md;
  reference.md Recent Changes.
- Decisions: additive `expanded` field in the existing `musicanyya.browser.v1` record, version stays 1 (R-1);
  tree state owned by `browserState` and not by the rail element (R-2); reveal on every index load and on open (R-4);
  after an open, the folder switches only when it cannot list the item (R-5); no new port until accounts exist (R-10).
- Problems / open questions: none; no owner decisions.
- Model fit: steps are tier `deep`; claude-opus-5.5 fits.
- Handoff: next = `/speckit:tasks`; no code changed yet, gate not run (docs only).

## 2026-10-01 - claude-opus-5.5 (tasks)
- Done: tasks.md, T001-T023 in 6 phases (Setup, Foundational, US1+US2 together because both are P1 and share the rail
  change, US3, US4, Polish). Tiers: 6 light (T001-T003, T019, T022, T023), 16 standard, 1 deep (T021 audit).
- Decisions: the persistence tests (T006) are in Phase 2 so they fail before the stored field exists (test-first);
  no RT review (no real-time path) and no owner gate (no open decision).
- Model fit: the tasks step is tier `standard`; claude-opus-5.5 fits.
- Handoff: next = `/speckit:analyze`, then `/speckit:implement` from T001; no code changed yet.
